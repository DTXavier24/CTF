Challenge Description:
<br>We are given a list of points in the plane. We need to determine if it is possible to draw a single line that passes through all the points in the list without lifting the pen.

Be careful while scripting the solution, as the server will only accept a limited number of requests. 
Please use sleeps in your script to avoid being blocked or damaging the server.

## Solution
Honestly, this challenge doesn't consider web, is more like miscellaneous.

Anyway, solution is attached to ```Solution.py```
