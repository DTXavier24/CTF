Challenge Description:
<br>Hm, this app seems pretty empty. Isn't it?

## Solution
First, we need to decompile the apk file [http://www.javadecompilers.com/apk]

Download it as zip file

unzip it and use grep to get flag

Oops, only get one part. But notice it's using flag1, why just grep with 'flag'
